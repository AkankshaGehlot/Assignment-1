                    <br>LeBron James is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball 
                    Association (NBA). He is widely considered to be one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history. 
                    Discussions ranking him as the greatest basketball player of all time have often been subject to 
                    significant debate, with frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.<br><br>
                    James's teams have played in eight consecutive NBA Finals (2011â€“2018 seasons) between the Miami Heat and 
                    Cleveland Cavaliers. His accomplishments include three NBA championships, four NBA Most Valuable Player 
                    (MVP) Awards, three Finals MVP Awards, and two Olympic gold medals. James holds the all-time record for 
                    playoffs points, is third in all-time points, and eighth in all-time assists. James was selected to the 
                    All-NBA First Team twelve times (all-time record), made the All-Defensive First Team five times, and has 
                    played in sixteen All-Star Games, in which he was selected All-Star MVP three times.
